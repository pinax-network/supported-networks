# The Graph networks registry

This repository manages a registry of networks in The Graph ecosystem. Latest version of the registry can be found here: https://graphregistry.pages.dev/TheGraphNetworksRegistry.json

## Adding/updating a chain

- add/update a network JSON in the `registry` directory. TODO: add detailed fields descriptions and best practices
- [optional] validate with `bun validate` (see below for local setup steps)
- [optional] format with `bun format`
- increment patch version in `package.json`
- open a PR. This will trigger validation checks and will signal if there are any issues with new definitions

## Structure of the repository

- `schemas/`: Contains the schema for the registry
- `registry/`: Contains the networks JSONs (edit these)
- `public`: Contains all generated registry versions (don't edit those)
- `src/`: Contains scripts to validate networks JSONs and generate the resulting registry JSON

## Setup

- install `bun`: https://bun.sh/
- `git clone` the repository
- install dependencies `bun install --no-save`
- rename `.env.example` to `.env`
- [optional] get your free [Studio API key](https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/) and set it in the `.env` file - we will need it to run a few queries to do some network validation

## Scripts usage

- `bun generate:types` - generate types from schema if schema has changed to use for validation
- `bun validate:schema` - validate networks JSONs against the schema
- `bun validate:networks` - additional semantic validation of networks JSONs, i.e. uniqueness, relations, urls, ethereum chain list, graph network, icons, etc
- `bun generate:registry` - generate resulting registry JSON in `./dist`
- `bun validate:registry` - validate generated registry in `./dist` against the schema
- `bun format` - format JSON and TS files with prettier
- `bun format:check` - check JSON and TS formatting with prettier
- `bun all` - do all of the above

## Versioning

### Schema Version

Registry schema has a MAJOR.MINOR semantic version, i.e. `v1.2`

When version needs to be incremented:

- MAJOR version: breaking schema change, i.e. field type change, new mandatory field, field removal
- MINOR version: backward compatible schema change, i.e. new optional field, new enum variant

### Registry version

Published registry has a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH semantic version, i.e. `v1.2.3` where MAJOR.MINOR corresponds to the schema version

When version needs to be incremented:

- MAJOR/MINOR version: when schema is updated change MAJOR and MINOR versions to reflect the schema
- PATCH version: new network added, existing network entry updated

## Releases

Every PR merge triggers a GitHub action that generates new registry version, formats it, commits, publishes a release and deploys
4 registry JSON files with the identical contents are deployed in addition to existing ones.
Assuming current version is v1.2.3, the following files with identical content are published:

- https://graphregistry.pages.dev/TheGraphNetworksRegistry.json
- https://graphregistry.pages.dev/TheGraphNetworksRegistry_v1_2_3.json
- https://graphregistry.pages.dev/TheGraphNetworksRegistry_v1_2_x.json
- https://graphregistry.pages.dev/TheGraphNetworksRegistry_v1_x_x.json

## Registry Usage

In your application you can pull one of the registry JSONs above depending on your use case - whether it's pinned to a specific registry version, whether you allow backwards compatible schema changes or you just need the latest one.

Typical use cases:

- Codegens and other tools for The Graph ecosystem
- Indexer infrastructure setup/validation
- Marketing and website
- Docs
